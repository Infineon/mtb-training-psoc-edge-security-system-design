# PSOC™ Edge Training - Designing a secure system

This training is part of the PSOC™ Edge security series and provides an overview of strategies
and best practices for designing secure embedded systems using PSOC™ Edge devices. 
It covers key security concepts, threat modeling, hardware and software protection mechanisms,
secure boot, encryption, and system-level design considerations.
The presentation aims to guide engineers in implementing robust security features to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of embedded applications.
